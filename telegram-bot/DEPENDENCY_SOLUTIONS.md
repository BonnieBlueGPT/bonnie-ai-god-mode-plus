# 🚨 DEPENDENCY CONFLICT SOLUTIONS 🚨

## Critical Problem
**WebSockets Version Conflict:**
- `python-telegram-bot==21.3` requires `websockets==15.0.1`
- `realtime` (supabase dependency) requires `websockets<13,>=11`
- **CONFLICT:** Cannot satisfy both requirements

## 🔧 Solution Options (Priority Order)

### ✅ SOLUTION 1: Ultra-Minimal (FASTEST DEPLOYMENT)
Use `requirements-emergency.txt` - no version constraints:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-emergency.txt
```

**Pros:** Bypasses all conflicts, fastest deployment  
**Cons:** Less predictable versions

### ✅ SOLUTION 2: Backwards Compatibility (MOST STABLE)  
Use `requirements-backwards.txt` - proven stable versions:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-backwards.txt
```

**Pros:** Tested compatibility, stable  
**Cons:** Older features

### ✅ SOLUTION 3: Constrained Modern (BALANCED)
Use `requirements.txt` - modern with constraints:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Pros:** Modern features with safety constraints  
**Cons:** May still have edge case conflicts

### ✅ SOLUTION 4: Latest Versions (EXPERIMENTAL)
Use `requirements-alternative.txt` - cutting edge:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-alternative.txt
```

**Pros:** Latest features  
**Cons:** Highest risk of conflicts

## 🚀 PowerShell Commands (Execute in Order)

### 🔥 EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT (Recommended First Try):
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Gamer\bonnie-ai\bonnie-ai-god-mode-plus\backend\telegram-bot"

# Ultra-minimal approach
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force galatea_venv -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python -m venv galatea_venv
galatea_venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements-emergency.txt

# Test if it works
python -c "import telegram, supabase, aiohttp; print('✅ All core imports successful')"
```

### 🛡️ STABLE FALLBACK (If emergency fails):
```powershell
pip install -r requirements-backwards.txt
```

### ⚡ MODERN APPROACH (If stable works but you want newer):
```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔍 Debugging Commands

### Test Core Imports:
```powershell
python -c "
try:
    import telegram
    print('✅ Telegram: OK')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'❌ Telegram: {e}')

try:
    import supabase
    print('✅ Supabase: OK')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'❌ Supabase: {e}')

try:
    import aiohttp
    print('✅ aiohttp: OK')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'❌ aiohttp: {e}')
"
```

### Check WebSocket Versions:
```powershell
pip show websockets realtime python-telegram-bot
```

## ✅ Current Status
- **requirements-emergency.txt**: ✅ Ultra-minimal (FASTEST)
- **requirements-backwards.txt**: ✅ Stable old versions  
- **requirements.txt**: ✅ Modern with constraints
- **requirements-alternative.txt**: ✅ Latest experimental

## 🎯 Recommendation
**START WITH EMERGENCY**, then upgrade if needed:

1. Try `requirements-emergency.txt` first
2. If deployment succeeds, you're done
3. If you need specific features, try `requirements-backwards.txt`
4. Only use modern versions if absolutely necessary
